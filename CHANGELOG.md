# Kanvas CHANGELOG

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. Dates are in YYYY-MM-DD format.

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Initial prototype for Kanvas AI model with basic media generation functionality.
- `generate_media` function that can take a text description and return generated media (images, audio, etc.).
- Integration with DALL-E and Claude for multi-modal media creation.
- Documentation setup: `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and `LICENSE.md`.
- Added initial Jupyter notebooks for setup, integration, and performance testing (`notebooks/` folder).
- Kanvas API setup to handle media requests from external applications.
- Basic tokenomics and KANVA token introduction in documentation.

### Changed
- Updated project structure to include separate directories for `src`, `data`, `examples`, and `docs`.
- Added modular AI models for seamless integration with third-party media generation systems (like DALL-E).
- Refined directory structure to include more reusable components for scalability.

## [1.0.0] - 2025-01-18
### Added
- **Full Kanvas AI model implementation:** This includes the first fully functional version of the model that supports image, audio, and 3D generation via text descriptions.
- **Kanvas token (KANVA):** Introduced KANVA tokens for accessing premium features in the ecosystem, including faster processing times and advanced model outputs.
- **Kanvas API:** Created API endpoints to allow external developers to interact with the model for their own media generation projects.
- **First Version of Documentation:** The `README.md` file has been created, along with API docs in `docs/`.
- **Basic Example Scripts:** Full examples for image generation, audio creation, and media combination have been added.
- **Interactive UI Design:** Kanvas web interface now allows users to input text and directly see AI-generated outputs.

### Changed
- **Performance Enhancements:** Significant optimizations to the AI model to handle large-scale media generation requests without crashing or performance bottlenecks.
- **Modular Code Structure:** Divided large code files into more manageable chunks for easier debugging and future upgrades.
- **Multi-Modal Dataset Expansion:** Expanded the multi-modal dataset that the AI is trained on to include better audio and 3D model datasets.
- **Integration with Claude and DALL-E:** Enhanced integration with Claude for vector-based designs and DALL-E for image generation.

### Fixed
- **Bug Fixes in AI Output:** Fixed an issue where certain descriptions would cause an error in media generation, ensuring more stable results across all models.
- **Documentation Errors:** Corrected several typos and broken links in the `README.md` and other documentation files.
- **API Request Handling:** Fixed issues with invalid API requests and response parsing, improving user experience.

## [0.5.0] - 2024-12-01
### Added
- **Initial Prototype for Multi-Modal AI Generation:** First draft of the Kanvas model that supports generating images and audio from text descriptions.
- **Basic Hybrid Media Creation:** Experimentation with combining different types of media (image + audio) in one output.
- **Early Stage Tokenomics:** Draft whitepaper for the Kanvas token (KANVA) outlining how users will use tokens for premium services like high-quality outputs and faster generation times.
- **Testing Environment:** Set up local development environment with testing suites for model evaluation.

### Changed
- **Revised Project Structure:** The project has been restructured to include separate folders for examples, data, and models to improve maintainability.
- **Refined Model Training:** The AI model was retrained on additional datasets to improve the quality of generated outputs, particularly for 3D models.
- **User Interface Improvements:** The initial UI was refined to include visual representations of generated media and interactive controls.

### Fixed
- **Stability Fixes for Media Generation:** Resolved issues with the AI not generating consistent media for certain types of text prompts.
- **API Response Fixes:** Fixed issues with inconsistent or slow API responses, particularly when requesting high-complexity media.
- **Error Handling in Integration:** Fixed issues with integrating external AI tools like Claude, ensuring smooth interoperability.

- **Initial API Setup:** Laid out the basic infrastructure for the Kanvas API to allow third-party integration.
- **Testing Framework:** Introduced a lightweight framework for running unit and integration tests for model outputs.

### Changed
- **Model Code Refactoring:** Refactored AI model code to allow for more flexible inputs and outputs.
- **Improved Text-to-Image Synthesis:** Tweaked image synthesis model to handle more complex descriptions and deliver higher-quality outputs.
- **Web UI Framework:** Adopted a new frontend framework (e.g., React) to allow for easier integration of AI models into the web interface.

### Fixed
- **Basic Bugs in Text Generation:** Fixed issues with certain text descriptions that led to incomplete or poor-quality media outputs.
- **Token Issues:** Fixed token-handling bugs related to accessing premium features, ensuring smooth user experience.
